## What is MultiStopwatch?  
Multistopwatch is an application for the organization of work. Simply, you can measure the time of every project and every task. This application helps to calculate the duration of the project. It might help optimize and predict project time. 
  
## Features  
Thanks to the built-in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-pert-how-can-we-use-dave-fourie-pmp-prince2-/">PERT</a>-Calculator you can also estimate project implementation time. It will allow you to build good habits and manage your time. In each project and stopwatch, you will find a diagram that shows the time of the tasks performed as a percentage. You can create any number of projects with tasks in a pleasant color palette. Projects can be added to favorites by clicking on the heart icon.
  
## Summary
This project arose in need of projects time calculation as well as optimization and time prediction. During the project, I had a lot of fun. In practice I exercised Angular and CleanArchitecture: AutoMaper - creating DTOs, NSwag - testing API and generating web API client, validations on several layers, and more.
