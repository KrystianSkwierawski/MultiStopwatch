Multistopwatch is an application for the organization of work. In simply way you can measure time of every project and every task. This application helps to calculate the duration of the project. It might be helpful in optimizing and predicting project time. Thanks to built-in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-pert-how-can-we-use-dave-fourie-pmp-prince2-/">PERT</a>-Calculator you can also estimate project implementation time.  It will allow you to build good habits and manage your time. In each project and stopwatch you will find a diagram that shows the time of the tasks performed as a percentage. 
You can create any number of project with tasks in a pleasant color palette. Projects can be added to favorites by cliking on the heart icon. This project arose in need of projects time calculation as well as optimization and time prediction.
